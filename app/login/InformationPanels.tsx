              If you are determined to be eligible for a waiver, you will be notified and provided
              with a unique waiver authorization. Although complete background checks take
              time to complete, we anticipate returning results as soon as they are received,
              provided there is no indication of a criminal history. Normally the process may take
              up to 5 business days to complete.
